# Flux: Font Layout UX

Flux *will be* a font layout editor. Currently this is in
a rapid prototyping ("spike") phase; there are many moving
parts and lots will change.

Flux relies heavily on my fontFeatures module for
representation of layout rules. Consequently, that module
is *also* rapidly changing to respond to the needs of this
project. All of the edges are bleeding.

Currently Flux only reads fonts in `.glyphs` format.

If you want to play:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m Flux
```
